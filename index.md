# Richard W. Frank

Hello and welcome to my website. I am a Senior Lecturer and the Research Community Coordinator in the [School of Politics and International Relations](http://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/people/dr-richard-w-frank) (SPIR) at the Australian National University (ANU).

My research focuses on the international political economy of political violence and human rights violations.

Feel free to poke around my website to learn about my [research](https://richardwfrank.com/research/), [teaching](https://richardwfrank.com/teaching/), and [service](https://richardwfrank.com/cv/). Let me know if you have any questions or need a copy of any of my work.
