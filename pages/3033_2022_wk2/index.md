In this week's class, I focus on the theoretical and empirical connections between economic development, economic insecurity, and conflict. My main case study is of Burundi in the years since the end of the Cold War. In the last three decades, the country has seen a civil war, contentious elections, economic and political isolation, and gradual reintegration into the world economy.
