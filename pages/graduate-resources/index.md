**Surviving Grad School**

There is the old saying that advise is worth exactly what you pay for it. However, having survived graduate school, you might find my thoughts on graduate school and the life of a political scientist in a research oriented PhD department useful.

First, organize your space and your time. As a graduate student you probably have little money and little time. However, I would say that one of the best uses of time is to take time to take a step back and plan both your semester and your career. It might sound rather pompous to do, but by trying to put it on a piece of paper or on a calendar it helps to look at the big picture. Planning your assignments if possible try and make sure that you spread out your papers so they are not clustered at the end of the semester or that you leave them until the night before to write.

Second, make sure that you have somewhere, whether an office desk, home desk, or library carrel where you have all the papers, articles, books and other necessities for doing work. Also make sure that it is expandable. If you are planning on making political science your career it is in your interest to at the start devise a storage system that is expandable. I have seen academics with piles of folders in all corners of their office but when you ask them about a particular project or article they know how to find it within a few seconds. I prefer to put all printed articles into a folder and label it with the last name of an author and the year the work was published. Then organize all authors alphabetically and then within one author by year. In this way my collection of articles have expanded from a small pile into over six drawers. When dealing with data collection and analysis, I have found Scott Long's "The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata" invaluable.

Third, find a work schedule that works for you and stick to it. Some people do their best work first thing after rolling out of bed, others enjoy writing late at night into the early hours of the morning. The important thing is to be sure that you are doing some amount of work on a regular basis. Just like some people struggle making the shift from high school to college, others have a difficult time making the transition to a graduate program. The key is to recognize what will work for you and what will be sustainable over time. Let me say, however, that the professors that I have worked with who are the most productive are the ones who treat academia like a job and schedule regular hours in the office.

Fourth, take your reputation seriously. You only get one chance to make a first impression both in your department and at conferences. More than one might think personal characteristics and personalities make a difference. Academics are people too and despite their efforts at objectivity personality is never truly able to be left at the door.

**Methods**

Learn them, love them. You can always fill in gaps in your knowledge of a substantive field, but a solid base in a number of different methods will serve you in good stead

**Conferences**

Just do it. The more practice you have presenting your research, the more comfortable you will be talking about it. Conferences are also great opportunities to meet the people you have been reading in class and your fellow graduate students who will become your peers. Midwest and Southern are often recommended as good starter conferences. They are sizable and reasonably easy to get into. Once you have presented your research at a few of the larger conferences, you might well gravitate to the smaller more specialized conferences in your subfield.

**Comprehensive Exams**

Comprehensive exams are your opportunity to pull together the different theoretical strands of your coursework. They are more than being able to regurgitate names and dates. Rather, they are about taking a position about an enduring debate in the field and backing it up in a coherent and well-organized manner. They are a major milestone in your graduate career.

There are as many ways to study for comps as there are graduate students. For me, I found keeping summaries of all relevant articles organized by research area in [OneNote](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/) helped me develop a mental map of the field. Further, in the few weeks leading up to the exam I spent several hours a day writing sample answers to previous questions (available in the department office) on the same computer I was going to use for the exam. Also, while you are studying for comp keep your eyes open for sources that might be useful in either narrowing your dissertation topic or for inclusion in your dissertation proposal.

**Online Resources**

There is a wealth of resources available to help you in surviving grad school, writing a paper, or working your way through a new method. I am also happy to talk with you in class or during office hours about your specific projects and/or questions.

A few to get you started:
