**Requesting a letter of recommendation**

Applications for graduate schools, internships, or study abroad programs are usually due in the fall or early winter. This is a busy time for faculty members who often write a number of recommendations for former students. I am more than happy to write letters of recommendation for my students. It is in your interest to have me write as accurate and detailed letter of recommendation. The following suggestions will help ensure that I (or other professors) have ample time and details in writing your letter.

- Be sure to give me at least two weeks to write and send letters off. It takes time to write letters of recommendation, especially towards the end of the semester.
- Provide me with as much detailed information about yourself. The more I know about your experience and writing in my class, your reasons for applying to a particular program, as well as what your long-term plans are the more complete of a letter I can write.
- I will not write a letter for a current student who has not had at least one prior class with me. This ensures that I am able to comment on your abilities over the course of at least one semester.

[**Writing an undergraduate political science research paper**](http://richardwfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/frankundergraduatewritingguide.pdf)

Writing a good political science paper, like any written work, is as much art as science. Regardless of the subject, however, the writing process often entails many of the same steps, and papers share a similar structure. Over the years, I have read many papers that make similar errors. The guide above describes the basic tenets of undergraduate political science research paper writing I expect my students to follow when submitting a paper for my class. It will hopefully help you in formulating your research area and question—as well as clarify my expectations for your final paper.

This is by no means the only way to approach writing a paper, but it is consistent with expectations for other undergraduate political science classes—both at UNO and at other institutions. At the end of this handout I list a number of writing resources I have found helpful in my own writing and in preparing this handout.
