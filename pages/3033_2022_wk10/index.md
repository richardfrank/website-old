This week we discuss how natural disasters present a critical challenge for countries with limited state capacity. We also explore how disasters can provide an opportunity for both conflict onset and termination. In the workshop we explore natural disaster data and link a particular conflict of students’ choosing to potentially relevant disasters. We also explore connections between covid-19 case data to state capacity and conflict.
