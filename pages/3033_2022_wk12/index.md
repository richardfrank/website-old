This week we focus on how international actors respond to climate change-driven challenges. In particular, we focus on (1) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and (2) international efforts to adapt to (and profit from) a changing strategic Arctic environment. In the workshop we engage with both the human security chapter of the fifth (2014) IPCC report and an analysis of this report by [Gleditsch and Nordås (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629814000791?via%3Dihub). We also explore the [OECD's climate-related aid database](https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/datavisualisations/). Finally, we end the semester by drawing a path-diagram summarizing this class' causal mechanisms and compare it to the ones we drew in week 1.
