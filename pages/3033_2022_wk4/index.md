In this week's class, I discuss environmental scarcity as a driving force (directly and indirectly) for civil conflict. This week is the last week in Part 1 of this class. Part 1 focuses on the main types of explanations for civil conflict. Part 2 then turns to subtypes of environmental and social drivers of conflict, one per week.
