This week we focus on how countries, business, and citizens respond to climate change-driven challenges. In particular, we focus on (1) how militaries are increasingly being tasked to respond to natural disasters and (2) how militaries are grappling with climate-change-driven security challenges. In the workshop we conduct a close reading of an assigned journal article, explore countries’ national adaptation plans, and connect students’ research projects to the weekly topic.
