This week we discuss how natural resources can be both a blessing and a curse for developing countries. Specifically, we discuss the resource curse and how resource wealth can increase the risk of conflict in developing countries. In the workshop we discuss assigned readings and grapple with how hard it can be to test different causal mechanisms when the observable implications of these theories can be so hard to test in practice.
