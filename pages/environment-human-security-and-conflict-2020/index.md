This course examines the linkages between environmental phenomena, human economic, political, and physical security, and violent political conflict. The prevalence of international and civil conflicts associated with control of (or access to) natural resources (e.g. water, food, energy resources), has exposed the tensions between traditional notions of security and human-centred security concerns. Students will conduct in-depth analyses of cases of environmental conflicts around the world in order to identify the key actors, their projected values and interests, as well as the implications of different alternatives. While the course highlights the politics behind conflicts, it includes contributions from other disciplines and fields.
